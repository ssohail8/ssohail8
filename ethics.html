        <h2>Guidelines for Developers</h2>
        <p>As developers, we have a big responsibility to make sure our software is safe, private, and easy for everyone to use. Hereâ€™s what we focus on:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Software Safety:</strong> We thoroughly test our software to find and fix any issues. This ensures that our software is reliable and safe for all users.</li>
            <li><strong>Privacy:</strong> We protect user data seriously. We use strong protection methods to keep everyone's personal information safe and private.</li>
            <li><strong>Accessibility:</strong> We design our software so that everyone, including people with disabilities, can use it easily. We follow international guidelines to make our software accessible to as many people as possible.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Harvard University's IT Professional Code of Conduct reminds us that we must always act responsibly and ethically, especially when handling user information.</p>

        <h2>Ethical Considerations for Data Scientists</h2>
        <p>As data scientists, our decisions can impact many areas. We are committed to handling data ethically:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Responsible Data Management:</strong> We take care of data from the moment we collect it until we no longer need it. We have clear rules on how to handle data and we stick to these rules.</li>
            <li><strong>Privacy and Confidentiality:</strong> Keeping data private is crucial. We use methods that keep personal information safe and prevent unauthorized access.</li>
            <li><strong>Avoiding Bias:</strong> We constantly check our work to avoid any unfair bias in our data or results. We want to make sure our outcomes are fair and helpful.</li>
            <li><strong>Transparency and Accountability:</strong> We are open about how we work and the limitations of our methods. Being transparent helps others understand and trust our work, ensuring that decisions are made based on accurate information.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The Federal Data Strategy Data Ethics Framework guides us to make decisions that respect privacy, ensure accountability, and are transparent, thus building trust in what we do.</p>
